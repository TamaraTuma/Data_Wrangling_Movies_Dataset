# Data_Wrangling_Movies_Dataset
Cleaning the dataset called "Movies" is an essential step in preparing the data for further analysis and extracting valuable insights. The dataset contained information about various movies, such as their titles, release dates, genres, ratings, duration and other relevant attributes. However, raw data often contains inconsistencies, missing values, errors, and noise that can hinder accurate analysis and interpretation.

The goal of data cleaning is to enhance the dataset's quality, ensuring it is accurate, complete, and structured in a consistent manner. The process involves several key steps:
1. **Data Inspection**: I began by inspecting the dataset to get a comprehensive understanding of its structure, the columns it contains, and the overall data quality. I Identified potential issues like missing values, duplicate entries, and outliers.
2. **Handling Missing Data**: Missing data is a common challenge in datasets. Deciding on an appropriate strategy to handle missing values, such as imputing them with mean, median, or mode values, or dropping rows with missing data based on the context.
3. **Dealing with Duplicates**: Checking for and remove any duplicate entries from the dataset, as they can lead to biased analysis and inflate certain observations.
4. **Data Type Conversion**: I ensured that each attribute is in the correct data type. For example, dates should be converted to datetime objects, and numerical data should be converted to appropriate numerical formats.
